Capitalizing on the fact that robots are uniquely suited to perform repetitive tasks accurately, I investigate how robots could complement human experience in the form of activist art. I attempt to create robotic art that could raise awareness for Comfort Women, who were victims of sexual exploitation during World War II. I probe into the relationships between science, technology, and society to reason how robots might be utilized to reduce them.
